## What is Amazon EC2

# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a foundational and highly popular web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
# It allows users to rent virtual servers, known as "instances," on which they can run applications, host websites, or perform various computing tasks in the cloud.
# EC2 instances provide scalable compute capacity, and users can choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases.
