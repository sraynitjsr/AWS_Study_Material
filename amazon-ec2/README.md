# What is Amazon EC2

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a foundational and highly popular web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
### It allows users to rent virtual servers, known as "instances," on which they can run applications, host websites, or perform various computing tasks in the cloud.
### EC2 instances provide scalable compute capacity, and users can choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases.

# Key features and characteristics of Amazon EC2 are below mentioned:

### Scalability: Users can easily scale their compute capacity up or down by launching or terminating instances as needed. This scalability is particularly valuable for applications with variable workloads.

### Variety of Instance Types: EC2 offers a diverse selection of instance types optimized for different workloads, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and GPU instances. Users can choose the instance type that best suits their application's requirements.

### Operating System Flexibility: EC2 supports various operating systems, including Linux and Windows. Users can choose the OS that fits their application's needs and can also bring their custom OS images.

### Instance Configuration: Users can configure their instances by selecting the amount of CPU, memory, storage, and network performance required for their applications. This allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation.

### Auto Scaling: EC2 can be integrated with AWS Auto Scaling, enabling automatic scaling of instances based on predefined conditions. This ensures that applications can handle varying traffic loads efficiently.

### Security: EC2 instances can be launched within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing users to control network access, create private subnets, and implement security groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to secure their infrastructure.

### Storage Options: EC2 instances can be associated with various types of storage, including Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for block storage and Amazon S3 for object storage. Users can also attach additional storage volumes to instances as needed.

### Pay-as-You-Go Pricing: EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where users are billed only for the compute capacity and resources they consume, with options for on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances for cost optimization.

### Elastic Load Balancing: EC2 instances can be paired with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, improving application availability and fault tolerance.

### Integration with AWS Services: EC2 instances can easily integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and more, to build comprehensive and scalable cloud-based applications.
