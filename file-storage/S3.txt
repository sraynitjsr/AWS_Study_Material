To list the contents of an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, you can use the aws s3 ls command followed by the name of the S3 bucket. Here's an example => aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name

This will list all the objects in the my-bucket-name bucket. If you want to list only the objects in a specific subdirectory within the bucket, you can append the subdirectory path to the bucket name => aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name/my-subdirectory

The aws s3 sync command is a powerful and useful command in AWS CLI that allows you to synchronize the contents of a local directory with an S3 bucket or synchronize the contents of an S3 bucket with a local directory => 
                                aws s3 sync <source> <destination> [options]
                                aws s3 sync /path/to/local/dir s3://my-bucket-name
                                
                                This above command uploads all the files in the /path/to/local/dir directory that are not already in the my-bucket-name S3 bucket and removes any files from the bucket that are not present in the local directory.
