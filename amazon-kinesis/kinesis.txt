Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data records in real time.

Amazon Kinesis is a managed, scalable, cloud-based service that allows real-time processing of streaming large amount of data per second. It is designed for real-time applications and allows developers to take in any amount of data from several sources, scaling up and down that can be run on EC2 instances, it is used to capture, store, and process data from large, distributed streams such as event logs and social media feeds. After processing the data, Kinesis distributes it to multiple consumers simultaneously.

How to Use Amazon KCL?
It is used in situations where we require rapidly moving data and its continuous processing. Amazon Kinesis can be used in the following situations −

1. Data log and data feed intake − We need not wait to batch up the data, we can push data to an Amazon Kinesis stream as soon as the data is produced. It also protects data loss in case of data producer fails. For example: System and application logs can be continuously added to a stream and can be available in seconds when required.

2. Real-time graphs − We can extract graphs/metrics using Amazon Kinesis stream to create report results. We need not wait for data batches.

3. Real-time data analytics − We can run real-time streaming data analytics by using Amazon Kinesis.
